# Gmail Auto Email Reply using Gemini API and pyDatalog

This script fetches the most recent email from your Gmail inbox and uses Gemini's generative AI to draft a polite, formal reply based on simple logic rules defined using first-order logic (FOL) with pyDatalog.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-api-python-client`
- `google-generativeai`
- `pyDatalog`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client google-generativeai pyDatalog
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Obtain `credentials.json` from Google Cloud Console.
2. Run initial auth flow to generate `token.json`.
3. Add your Gemini API key to the script.
4. Run the script to see the auto-generated email reply.

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This example assumes the latest email has a plain text or base64 body. You might need to enhance MIME parsing for more complex emails.

Once you've finalized your Gemini API key and added some error handling, youâ€™re all set for version control! Want help writing a `.gitignore` or setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to auto-trigger replies?
